McUtils is a set of utilities written by the McCoy group for the McCoy group to handle common things we do, like pulling data from electronic structure calculations, doing unit conversions, interpolating functions, making attractive plots, getting finite difference derivatives, performing fast, vectorized operations, etc.

This provides a binder environement for testing McUtils out.
